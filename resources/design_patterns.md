# Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software

### Chapter 1: Introduction
- **Overview:** Introduces the concept of design patterns, emphasizing their importance in creating reusable object-oriented software.
- **Design Pattern Elements:** Describes the essential elements of a design pattern: name, problem, solution, and consequences.
- **Examples:** Explain how patterns can be applied to solve recurring design problems, with a focus on flexibility and reusability.

### Chapter 2: A Case Study
- **Design Problems:** Discusses common design problems encountered in object-oriented software development.
- **Document Structure:** Provides a detailed example of designing a document editor, focusing on structure, formatting, and user interface.
- **Multiple Look-and-Feel Standards:** Explains how to support different look-and-feel standards using design patterns.
- **Multiple Window Systems:** Describes techniques for supporting various window systems.
- **User Operations:** Covers the design of user operations like spell-checking and hyphenation.

### Chapter 3: Creational Patterns
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

1. **Abstract Factory**
   - **Intent:** Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
   - **Example:** GUI toolkit with different look-and-feels.
   
2. **Builder**
   - **Intent:** Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
   - **Example:** Building a complex text document.

3. **Factory Method**
   - **Intent:** Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
   - **Example:** Dialog boxes that create different types of buttons.

4. **Prototype**
   - **Intent:** Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
   - **Example:** Using a prototypical instance to create new objects in a graphics editor.

5. **Singleton**
   - **Intent:** Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
   - **Example:** A print spooler or a database connection.

### Chapter 4: Structural Patterns
Structural patterns deal with object composition or the structure of relationships between entities.

1. **Adapter**
   - **Intent:** Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
   - **Example:** Making a class compatible with a legacy system.

2. **Bridge**
   - **Intent:** Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
   - **Example:** Separating a GUI abstraction from its platform-specific implementations.

3. **Composite**
   - **Intent:** Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
   - **Example:** Graphical objects in a drawing application.

4. **Decorator**
   - **Intent:** Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
   - **Example:** Adding borders or scroll bars to windows.

5. **Facade**
   - **Intent:** Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
   - **Example:** Simplifying the interaction with a complex library.

6. **Flyweight**
   - **Intent:** Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
   - **Example:** Managing a large number of graphical objects like characters in a text editor.

7. **Proxy**
   - **Intent:** Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
   - **Example:** Implementing lazy initialization, access control, or logging.

### Chapter 5: Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

1. **Chain of Responsibility**
   - **Intent:** Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.
   - **Example:** Event handling in a graphical user interface.

2. **Command**
   - **Intent:** Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with different requests.
   - **Example:** Implementing undo functionality in a text editor.

3. **Interpreter**
   - **Intent:** Given a language, define a representation for its grammar and an interpreter to interpret sentences in the language.
   - **Example:** Parsing and interpreting a simple language.

4. **Iterator**
   - **Intent:** Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
   - **Example:** Traversing a list or a collection.

5. **Mediator**
   - **Intent:** Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
   - **Example:** Managing interactions between GUI components.

6. **Memento**
   - **Intent:** Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
   - **Example:** Implementing checkpoints and undo mechanisms.

7. **Observer**
   - **Intent:** Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
   - **Example:** Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

8. **State**
   - **Intent:** Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
   - **Example:** Implementing state-dependent behavior in a vending machine.

9. **Strategy**
   - **Intent:** Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
   - **Example:** Sorting algorithms in a collection class.

10. **Template Method**
    - **Intent:** Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
    - **Example:** Implementing a framework where the steps of an algorithm are defined by abstract methods.

11. **Visitor**
    - **Intent:** Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
    - **Example:** Operations on nodes of a complex object structure like a parse tree.
